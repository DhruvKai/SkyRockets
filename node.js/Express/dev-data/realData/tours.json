This Magical valley is a secret location and known to few and therefore it is also known as Magic Valley. This valley is located higher up near the village of Malana and is a tranquil place, a must visit for any explorer. Feel close to nature and listen to the songs of the mighty mountains. Only camping facility is available here. This is an ideal location to spend your time in nature with fewer people around and only good vibes. Malana Dam is the starting point of the trek. Our guide will take you through a route of approx 4 km and take you to witness two hidden waterfalls en route. You will pass along the Malana stream and the sound of the flowing water is surely gonna calm your mind. Waichin Valley is said to be owned by the foreigners and this place has a different charm. This valley offers a fascinating view of the Himalayan ranges including the Animal Pass, Tiger Mouth Peak, and Khiksa Thaj Glacier. The population of the village is very low. The valley is also rich in flora and fauna. There are no cafes in Waichin, which is one of the things that separates it from Malana and Kasol, it is rather a more peaceful place. During nights this place looks beautiful with billion stars above you. This place will make you fall hopelessly and irretrievably in love with Himachal and its beauty!",
